Name     : Manan Darji
Roll No. : ************
```

**I Have Submitted Both Part A & B In One Folder But Functionality of both are implemented.**
---
* This Repo Contain 6 cpp files
  * 1 Bootstap Server File.
  * 4 Diffrent Servers Files. [as mentioned below]
  * 1 Client File.
```
1 | Bootstrap_Server.cpp  |
2 | Server_IMAGE.cpp      | 
3 | Server_TEXT.cpp       | 
4 | Server_PDF.cpp        | 
5 | Server_VIDEO.cpp      | 
6 | Client.cpp            | 
```
<br/>

 **I Have Folder Structure for Storage as follows**
---
```
Storage
    |---Client        : Will Contain Files Which Will be downloded from any server
    |---Server_IMAGE  : Contains Images For Server With Same Name [JPG / PNG]
    |---Server_TEXT   : Contains Txt Files For Server With Same Name 
    |---Server_VIDEO  : Contains Video Files For Server With Same Name [mp4]
    |---Server_PDF    : Contains  PDFs For Server With Same Name 
```


# ``How To Run Code?``


 * First we Have to compile the code
```bash
g++ -o Bootstrap Bootstrap_Server.cpp 

g++ -o Server_IMAGE Server_IMAGE.cpp -lpthread 
g++ -o Server_TEXT Server_TEXT.cpp -lpthread 
g++ -o Server_PDF Server_PDF.cpp -lpthread 
g++ -o Server_VIDEO Server_VIDEO.cpp -lpthread 

g++ -o client Client.cpp
```
* copy below for one line command for convince. [ Compile ]
```
g++ -o Server_IMAGE Server_IMAGE.cpp -lpthread ; g++ -o Server_TEXT Server_TEXT.cpp -lpthread ; g++ -o Server_PDF Server_PDF.cpp -lpthread ; g++ -o Server_VIDEO Server_VIDEO.cpp -lpthread ; g++ -o Bootstrap Bootstrap_Server.cpp ; g++ -o client Client.cpp
```


<br/>

### Run **Bootstrap** Server with
---  
```bash
./Bootstrap
```
* follow this step by step
  * Bootstrap Server will run on 127.0.0.1 by default
  * Enter Port No to host server on [ I took 9999 ]*
    * this is statically defined in each server so only use 9999.
  * it will start listing on that port No : `9999` 

<br/>

### Run Diffrent **Servers** with this commands Using this 4 Diffrent Terminals.
---
```bash
./Server_IMAGE
./Server_TEXT
./Server_PDF
./Server_VIDEO
```
* follow this step by step for each server
  * Bootstrap Server will run on 127.0.0.1 by default
  * Enter Port No to host server on 
    * You can take any port number and it will be register on Bootsrap server
  * it will register with port no and other detail on Bootstrap server
  * then will start listing on that port number given 

<br/>

### Run Client with 
##### you can run multiple client using same
---
```bash
./client
```

* follow this step by step
  * Server will run on 127.0.0.1 by default
  * first it will fetch info from the Bootstrap for available servers list
  * it will look something like this
    ```bash
    -------------------------------------
    IP           | 127.0.0.1
    PORT         | 8888
    SERVICENAME  | IMAGE_SERVER
    SERVICETYPE  | IMAGE
    ACCESS_TOKEN | IMAGE1234
    -------------------------------------

    -------------------------------------
    IP           | 127.0.0.1
    PORT         | 7777
    SERVICENAME  | VIDEO_SERVER
    SERVICETYPE  | VIDEO
    ACCESS_TOKEN | VIDEO1234
    -------------------------------------

    -------------------------------------
    IP           | 127.0.0.1
    PORT         | 6666
    SERVICENAME  | TEXT_SERVER
    SERVICETYPE  | TEXT
    ACCESS_TOKEN | TXT1234
    -------------------------------------

    -------------------------------------
    IP           | 127.0.0.1
    PORT         | 4444
    SERVICENAME  | PDF_SERVER
    SERVICETYPE  | PDF
    ACCESS_TOKEN | ABC1234
    -------------------------------------

    ```
  * **Now client will connect with each server `Sequentially` and give you options for the files which are availabel on that server.**
  * something like this:
    ```
    // For Pdf Server
    ------------------------------------------------------
    index name
    0   .
    1   ..
    2   CPP_CHEAT_SHEET.pdf
    3   Assignment3.pdf
    4   
    ------------------------------------------------------

    ```
  
  * now you can use below commands to interact with client
    ```
    ------------------------------------------------------
    Commands : 
    GETFL -  To Get a File List from Server
    GET   -  To Get a File
    BYE   -  To TERMINATE Program on Client Side

    Enter Command :
    ```
  
  * Enter `GETFL` in order to get list of files available on server 
  * you will get something like this
  * ```
    index name
    0   .
    1   ..
    2   SUN_GRASS.png
    3   CITY_OF_NIGHT.jpg
    4   KING.png
    5  
    ------------------------------------------------------
    USE Command GET inorder to get that file
    ------------------------------------------------------
    ```
  * Now Use `GET` Command to Get Requird File with appropriate Index Number
  * It will ask for Index of file
  * ```
    PLEASE ENTER INDEX OF FILE :  
    ```
  * Enter proper index number - `EX : 3 for CITY_OF_NIGHT.jpg`
  * **Please do not enter improper index number** `EX : 0,1,5 in this case`
    * this will crash server [ this is not handled due to time constraint ]
    * on Entering Index Which is not there in List it will give something like:
    ```
    ------------------------------------------------------
    Please Enter Correct Index, FILE NOT AVAILABEL!
    ------------------------------------------------------
    ```
  * it will Download that file like
  * ```
    ||Client Log|| : File Creted.
    ||Client Log|| : Total Size Of File to be Receive 3459455
    ||Client Log|| : Number of Bytes Receive  : 51200 | Total Data Sent 51200
    ||Client Log|| : Number of Bytes Receive  : 51200 | Total Data Sent 102400
    ||Client Log|| : Number of Bytes Receive  : 51200 | Total Data Sent 153600
    .
    .
    .
    ||Client Log|| : Number of Bytes Receive  : 51200 | Total Data Sent 3430400
    ||Client Log|| : Number of Bytes Receive  : 51200 | Total Data Sent 3481600

    ||Client Log|| : Received 3481600 Bytes of Data
    ||Client Log|| : Data Not Received 0 Bytes
    ||Client Log|| : File Saved Successfully.
    ```
  * You can Use `BYE` Command to Terminate the connection with current Server And Goto Next Server in a list if available.
  * To test The `INVALID CLIENT` you will get option at start to send wrong token just to demonstrate.
  ```
    ------------------------------------------------------
    Do You Want to test Client Token validation : Enter[yes=1/ no=0]
    1
    Will sent This Value as wrong Token : WrongValueToken1234
    ||Send LOG|| : Response - 32
    ------------------------------------------------------
    ||Resv LOG|| : DATA Received - 3
    ------------------------------------------------------
    Invalid Client
    ------------------------------------------------------
